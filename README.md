# ShortestPath
An attempt to calculate shortest path between recipients using Dijkstra algorithm.  

## Problem Description
-----------
Suppose you have a network of friends and want to ship a package to any one of 
your friends at the optimal (lowest) cost. As common in life, some of your friends 
live closer to you than others. Instead of representing your friends in terms of a distance 
of how far they live from you (or their friends), we will represent them in terms of 
abstract units called `HARD` which define the difficulty of shipping a package. For example, 
if one of your friends lives on the Moon and another across the street from you, it is 
magnitude harder to ship a package to the Moon than across the street. So a relationship 
between you and your friend on the Moon may be defined as `1000000 HARD`, while the 
relationship between you and your friend across the street as `5 HARD`. Also, remember 
that in your network, your friends may have other friends so an optimal shipping cost 
may not always be direct shipping from You to your friend, but perhaps through a number 
of your friends. 

To each of your friends you can ship a package of certain weight and dimensions at a 
fixed cost. The formula for computing the shipment is the same for all of your 
friends in the network and is as follows:
```
{shipping cost}(EUR) = sqrt(sum(HARD)) * {normalized weight}(kg)
```
The cost is represented to the nearest two decimals (eg: 24,33 EUR). A normalized package 
weight is the grater value of an actual weight or a volumetric weight.

A `volumetric weight` (sometimes called dimentional weight) is a formula often applied by 
carriers to take into account volume as a function of weight. A light package that 
takes up a lot of space is just as difficult to ship as a small package that weighs a lot. 
The volumetric formula is defined as:
```
{Width x Length x Height}(cm) / 5000 = {Volumetric Weight}(kg) rounded up to the nearest 0,5kg
```
A practical example of this is [DHL](http://wap.dhl.com/serv/volweight.html). For example, 
a package of `width=26cm, length=10cm and height=11cm` that weighs `400 grams` would  
have a `normalized weight = 1kg` because volumetric weight defined as `2860/5000 = 0,572kg` 
rounded up to the `nearest 0,5kg` is `1kg`.

Suppose you have five friends in your network and this is how hard it is to ship a package 
to them:
```
You => Stefan:  100 HARD 
You => Amir:   1042 HARD 
You => Martin:  595 HARD 
You => Adam:     10 HARD 
You => Philipp: 128 HARD
```
You can assume `HARD` units are `integers`. 

You also know how hard it is for some of your friends to ship a package between themselves, but 
since not all of your friends may be friends with each other you wouldn't know all shipping 
combinations. For example, you only know that:
```
Stefan => Amir: 850 HARD 
Stefan => Adam:  85 HARD 
Adam => Philipp:  7 HARD 
Adam => Martin: 400 HARD 
Diana => Amir:   57 HARD 
Diana => Martin:  3 HARD
```
_(notice that Diana is not your friend)_

Taking into account all of this information you know that you could ship a `1kg` (normalized weight) 
package to Philipp directly at a cost of `11,31 EUR` or you could ship through Adam for a 
total cost of `4,12 EUR`. Shipping through Adam is the optimal cost.

### TASK

Given a package, a network of friends with the shipping `HARD` units, and a friend to which 
you want to ship a package, write a Java program which always finds the lowest shipping cost 
possible from you to that friend.

Your program should have a comprehensive documentation so that it's obvious and intuitive for 
Allpago to run it. Provide unit tests. At minimum, you must provide a unit test capable of consuming a 
`CSV` file with definition of a your friend network and expected results. The format of a file is:
```
SOURCE,TARGET:HARD,TARGET:HARD ... 
@,TARGET,PACKAGE,COST
```
Both lines can appear multiple times. `SOURCE` is You or a friend for whom other friends and 
their respective hardness relationship is defined. You are always represented by the string 
`ME`. Your friends are always represented by first name. Friends with same first name are appended 
a differentiator such as a sequence (Jessica1, Jessica2, Jessica3, etc). For example, you could 
define your friend network in a `CSV` like this:
```
ME,Lisa:33,Peter:123,John:55 
Lisa,John:3 
Diana,Peter:11
```
Given example above, you have three friends: Lisa, Peter and John. You can ship to Lisa @ `33 HARD`, 
to Peter @ `123 HARD` and to John @ `55 HARD`. In addition, Lisa shipment to John is `3 HARD` 
and Diana can ship to Peter @ `11 HARD`. You cannot ship to Diana.

If the line begins with the `@` symbol, then it is an assertion line which means you are given 
a scenario which your test must pass. Each scenario will always be the correct shipping cost from You 
to someone in your network given package information. For example:
```
@,Lisa,5x6x7x1200,6.89 
@,Diana,6x10x8x1233,~
```
The first assertion states that a shipping cost for a `1.2kg (width=10cm, length=9cm, height=5cm)` 
package to Lisa should be `6.89 EUR`. The second assertion states that it's impossible to ship a 
package to Diana so the cost is a positive infinity.

You are not allowed to modify provided CSV files in any way.

### DELIVERABLE

Provide complete source code with all relevant documentation. Your program should pass the tests 
criteria given to you in `CSV`. Furthermore, Algorythma will test your program with several additional 
inputs that you are not given. Ideally, we would like to have a unit test which reads some 
directory (eg: `/tmp/Algorythma`) and validates your program against any number of `CSV` files inside 
that directory. In few sentences describe your design; in particular, tell us about your core 
algorithm. You are free to use any library that may help your task. You can even re-use Java 
code from the Internet if you find it useful, as long as you cite the source and explain why 
you used it.
